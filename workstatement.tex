\section{Introduction and Background} 
Humana Inc. is a leading health care provider headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. Human is developing this infusion program to sponsorship research project aim to improve the efficiency and new solution to this industry. The health care system in United State is under great pressure. The system is high costing but the results in term of customer satisfactory are very poor. New solutions are needed to bring talent idea, people into the challenge. As the company’s program’s aim toinspiration that guides us to meaningful activities that bring joy to our lives; to presents of the meaningful relationships in your life and connections within community; to feel of being safe and the assurance that you are protected and to have the energy, physical freedom and desire to thrive in living every day

\section{Scope of Work}
The scope of work for this project is to introduce a successful foreign public health policy and introduced to US. Using data regression analysis to model the public policy and quantify the results. Using US data and apply in the model, test and modify the model and generated valuable health care solution and evaluation. The all data will be from open public sources.

\section{Period of Performance}
The period of performance for the project is beginning on 10/01/2012 through 12/01/2012. All the research will be completed within this timeframe. The final report and presentation will be delivered. Any modifications or extensions will not be allowed. 

The sponsor currently has a limited capability to make such inference from a
track of moving object from an image, and our task is to provide them with 
a reasonably large collection of such features and algorithms to detect them. 

\section{Work Flow Chart}
Below listed major milestones of project’s different stage. Project will be expected to performing tasks throughout various stages of this project.  The following is a list of these tasks which will result in the successful completion of this project:


\underline {Kichoff:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Literature research, selection of successful public health policies. 
    \item Analysis on different policies and chose the best candidates. 
\end{itemize}




\underline {Design Phase:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop the model to quantify the results of the polies. 
    \item Doing regression analysis on categorical analysis on different parameter: sex, gender, race, income level, education level. 
   \item Modify and finalize the model
    \item Present formal report on the model and model validation. 
\end{itemize}

\underline {Apply Phase:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acquire sample or national data of specified region for analysis
    \item Acquire data and use the model to generated results according to the data.
    \item Model modification and policies modification to generate reasonable and better performance. 
    \item Present formal public policies case backed with modeling results. 
\end{itemize}

 
\underline {Project Closure:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formal report of a public policy consulting report
    \item Presentation of the project. 
\end{itemize}

 
\section{Milestones}
We have the following major deadlines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Work Statement due date, Oct 16, 2012,
    \item Midterm Presentation due date, Oct 17, 2012,
    \item Progress Report due date, Oct 26, 2012,
    \item Final Presentation due date, Nov 6, 2012,
    \item Final Report due date, Nov 30, 2012.
\end{itemize}

\section{Deliverable}
\subsection{From Team to Sponsor} % (fold)
The following outputs are expected from this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item List of features of ground track useful for determining the
        target object and disambiguating the objects' moving direction 
    \item Algorithms for detecting the aforementioned features from images
    \item Numerical experiment results reporting performance of the developed algorithms
    \item R package with a complete set of documentations along with some test 
        codes that can be used to reproduce our numerical and simulation test
        results,
    \item Technical report and presentations summarizing the work. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{From Sponsor to Team} % (fold)

In order for our project to be of successful one, we will need:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Images for training the numerical algorithms
    \item Computing resources
    \item Timely responses to inquiries, 
    \item Symposium attendance travel expenses.
\end{itemize}
